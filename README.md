## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

For a straightforward project, create a website where each team member provides explanations for two programming languages. The requirement is to design it with a clean appearance, resembling an authentic representation of a website. Additionally, each team member is tasked with crafting two JavaScript-related functions incorporated into the project.

Our team swiftly selected the programming languages we wished to showcase and established a concise backlog on Trello to guide our efforts. Subsequently, we commenced the development of the web application.

Although the process was not time-consuming, it proved to be a valuable project for grasping the fundamentals of JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, Sass, and HTML.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've improved my bootstrap5, sass, js and html abilities. Also working in a team was really great.

### 🧠 Brain:

### ⌚ Time management:

### 📓 New knowledge:

- **Javascript**: First time using Javascript and I kind off liked it. 
- **Sass**: Sass is basically CSS but more "powerfull". I would say I like it but sometimes code could get clustered.
- **bootstrap5**: Powerfull tool for basic styling, has it pro's and con's.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

This project made me understand github more and more. Aswell as the importance of teamwork.
